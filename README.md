# Merge-multiple-.pdf-into-a-single-.pdf-with-python  

This repository includes my code (python 2.7) for program which merges multiple .pdf files into a single .pdf file.  

In this repository there are two .py files -  
=> (pdf_merger.py) my original code (with user interface)  
=> (pdf_merger.py[bare_mininum].pdf) also my code but with the user face removed; the bare mininum for completing the same task. 

Required python modules/packages for both codes are; os and PyPDF2.
